# Create Embers
Embers with create for new versions

This is a weird project. I am sorry that I don't update Embers' Construct as at this point I am too detached from 1.12.2. As it currently 
seems Embers Rekindled will probably never get an update (or at least not in the next 5 years) so I decided to revamp the whole project.
This is NOT a port and old worlds won't be compatible. I am constructing this as an addon to the Create mod and if you ask me why I am doing
it like this or ask me to change it, go away and wait for BordListian to update Embers Rekindled.

So, I am not really far currently and I will see how much I will work on this.
